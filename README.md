YX : Haxe : PxShip
==================

> A Pixelated spaceship generator, inspired by [Dave Bollinger's Pixel Spaceships](http://davebollinger.org/works/pixelspaceships/), mostly based on [my own port of his script](https://github.com/yuigoto/yx-lib-infiniship).

Made a few tweaks and changed the pixel grid and ship format, to avoid copyright issues, though, as I might use this on a commercial product.

The code is highly unrefined, though, as I was just learning Haxe while building this one.

Feel free to use it and tweak it. ;)

Will refine and proper write this as soon as I can.

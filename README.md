# PxShip

Â®2014-2015 Fabio Yuiti Goto / SIXSIDED Developments

A Pixelated spaceship generator, inspired by Dave Bollinger's Pixel Spaceships (http://davebollinger.org/works/pixelspaceships/), mostly based on my own port of his script (https://github.com/yuigoto/infiniship).

Made a few tweaks and changed the pixel grid and ship format, to avoid copyright issues, though, as I might use this on a commercial product.

The code is highly unrefined, though, as I was just learning Haxe while building this one.

Feel free to use it and tweak it. ;)

Will refine and proper write this as soon as I can.
